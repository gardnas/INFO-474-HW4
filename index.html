            <li><strong>Context:</strong>This clock is for a classroom of students, proving a fun and nostalgic way to tell the time through displaying it on a chalkboard.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> I chose to display the chalkboard as green with a brown border to simulate an actaul chalkboard look. Also, I used a font that looks like handwriting and chose tally marks in groups of 5 becuase I thought this was nostalgic to when I was learning counting by doing this so I thought this could be aplied to representing time passing. </li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> I think I could add slight imperfections to teh tally marks themselves to simulate handwriting on a chalkboard better. Another thing to add could be adding a chalk dust particle effect just for design because writing with chalk produces a lot of chalk dust so somehow representing that.</li>

          <p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong>This clock is designed for students in a classroom or anyone within an education / teaching context to display time to students in a fun and nostalgic way using a ruler which based on teh measurement tells the current time.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> I chose to color the ruler similar to how I remeber using rulers as a student with teh wood light brown color to make it look liek an actual ruler. Then based on the measurements, it tells the time, so the small tick makrs on teh top are minutes, large ones are hours, then on the bottom side, one tick mark is added each second. Last, to add an interaaction I made the penicls hoverable to see exact time, as well as added a timer funciton which adds another pencil and functions as a time which could be helpful in class for timed activities.</li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> Adding another interaction such as setting a point in time in teh future which is like an alarm and then you can see another pencil with the time remaining. Also, maybe adding some sort of sharpening animation for the pencils to shorten over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Across all three iterations the feedback I received was using a more specific pointer instead of a highlight, adding something to measure instead of just a pointer, changing the bars to something to follow the context better, and some way to distinguish between AM/PM.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <figcaption>Step 1 — Some feedback that I got was that the highlight could be changed to a shape something similar to a pointer instead of just a highlight. So I chose to add a traingle. Also it was not clear what was hours and miniutes so I added a key to the top right to show that.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Step 3 — added bars to actaully use the ruler to "measure" something. After adding these bars I got feedback that I should make this similar to the context which I then had the idea to use pencils similar to another sketch that I had to follow the teaching / education context better.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Step 4 — changed the bars to pencils and added interaction. When you hover over the pencils you can see the exact time. Also added label for AM/PM since I got that feedback as well.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Step 5 — Here I added an interaction for so that when you click one of the green timer buttons a green pencil is added which is a timer. I thought that this would be useful for timing in class activities.</figcaption>

          <h3 id="sk4-narrative-title">Bubble Sheet Clock</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> This clock is for student who are taking a test, in which this clcook could be displayed as a more interesting way to tell time which also relates to the test they are taking (if it is both on a bubble sheet).</li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> I chose the multiple-choice bubble format because it's familair to students who have taken this type of test before and creates an similarity between bubbling in a certain time and selecting answers on a test. The hours section displays 24 bubbles arranged in 4 rows of 6 representing 24 hour time, while the minutes section shows 60 bubbles in 5 rows of 12 which is 0-59 minutes. Then the current hour and minute are "filled in" with solid black circles, just like marking an answer on a standardized test. For seconds, I created a large circular bubble that progressively fills clockwise like a pie chart from 0 to 60 seconds, with the current second number displayed in the center. Last, I added a pencil because I thought this added to the overall design and context.</li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> I could add some sort of animation when the minute changes like erasing the selected bubble and selecting the next minute/hour. Also, I could add sound effects of a pencil filling in the bubble which would be cool.  Something else oculd be somehow adding time remaining section if this was used in an actual test for students to see how much time they have remaining.</li>
